+ Just a simple app for fans of Zelda games and folklore.

+ Somewhat interested in seeing how many questions total I can get into this thing.

+ Would be pretty cool to get some hardcore fans involved and turn it into a full on game.

+ The goal is for the final presentation of the game to be arcade-like meets 'who wants to be a millionaire'

+ going to add functionality for the hearts to go down every time a question is answered wrong

+ later functionality will include things like -- gaining new items and heart containers -- replenishing life -- adding hearts to overall HP -- bonus questions -- secret side games, etc.

+ would like to have it hosted eventually and have a high schore board like oldscool arcade games

+ potential later functionality -- some type of actual game display -- just link and an enemy -- enemy type will be based on question difficulty -- some kind of animation features where he actually gets hit and can hit while "fighting and enemy" aka answering a question

+ open to other ideas to add functionality and features -- just wanted to do something with and for other fans
